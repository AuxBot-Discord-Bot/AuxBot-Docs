## Questions

### Why is AuxBot unresponsive?

- Check to see it the bot is online.
- First make sure that the command your trying to run has all of the correct arguments.
- Do you have a custom prefix(es)? If so reset them to the default by running: `!a prefix reset`.
- The bot is online and you don't have a custom prefix? The bot is probably restarting try again in a few seconds or minutes.
- Still have issues after waiting? Make sure that AuxBot has the correct permissions to view and send messages. It is best to give AuxBot the administrator permission to ensure proper functionality.

### Why did AuxBot not send my welcome banner?

This happens when the welcome background background is to large. This is more prone to happen when you have a GIF background.

### Why is AuxBot offline?

The main reason is for maintenance. This can vary in time. If the bot is ever offline for more then 2 hours then there is a problem.

For support, join our [support server](https://www.auxbot.xyz/redirect/support).

### Why did AuxBot send a "something has gone wrong" message?

This happens from time to time. It means that there is an issue with the code that needs to be resolved. For more support with these messages join our [support server](https://www.auxbot.xyz/redirect/support).

Upon joining the support server go to the AuxBot support channel and tell us you have an error. Please state what command you did that caused this issue and please also send the **Error Id** displayed at the bottom of the message.

These errors are usually fixed within 1 day or so.

### Disboard bump message doesn't send after 2 hours?

This only occurs when AuxBot has been down for longer then 2 hours, once AuxBot comes back online it will send your bump message.

### Why does my reminder not appear in my reminder list?

If your reminder is set to activate in under 1 minute it is put into a cache, hence why the reminder is not in the reminder list command.

### No response from the API, please try again soon?

This occurs when a dependency AuxBot uses does not respond or is offline. Their is nothing we can do about this unfortunately except for wait.
