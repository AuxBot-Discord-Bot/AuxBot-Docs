- Do you have a custom prefix(es)? If so reset them to the default by running: `!a prefix reset`.
- The bot is online and you don't have a custom prefix? The bot is probably restarting try again in a few seconds or minutes.
- Still have issues after waiting? Make sure that AuxBot has the correct permissions to view and send messages. It is best to give AuxBot the "Administrator" permission to ensure proper functionality.
